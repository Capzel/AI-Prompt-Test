To securely serialize and deserialize Python objects to and from a file, you can use the `pickle` module with careful considerations to avoid security vulnerabilities, especially when loading data. Here's how you can implement `save_object_to_file` and `load_object_from_file` functions with those considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a file."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return an object from a file."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: '{file_path}'")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Serialization (save_object_to_file)**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` to ensure the most efficient and up-to-date serialization method is used.
- **Deserialization (load_object_from_file)**: Ensure the file path exists to avoid unnecessary errors. Be aware that `pickle.load` can execute arbitrary code if the data being deserialized is tampered with. Only deserialize data from trusted sources.
- **File Handling**: Use `with open(...)` to ensure files are properly closed after processing.
- **Directory Creation**: Use `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` to ensure the directory exists before attempting to write a file, preventing potential errors.

Always validate and sanitize any file paths or data used in these functions and be cautious of deserializing data from untrusted sources.
