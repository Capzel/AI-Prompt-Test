To execute a SQL query string safely, you should avoid directly using string interpolation or concatenation due to the risk of SQL injection. Instead, use parameterized queries. Here's how you can do it using the `sqlite3` library as an example, which supports parameterized queries:

import sqlite3

def execute_safe_query(user_query, db_connection):
    try:
        cursor = db_connection.cursor()

        cursor.execute(*user_query)

        results = cursor.fetchall()

        cursor.close()

        return results

    except sqlite3.Error as error:
        print(f"Database error: {error}")
        return None

- **Parameterized Queries**: Use placeholders (`?`) in the SQL query and provide parameters as a separate tuple. This prevents SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated as data rather than executable code.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage database errors gracefully.
- **Resource Management**: Remember to close the cursor to free up database resources.

Note: This example assumes `user_query` is structured as a tuple, where the first element is the SQL statement with placeholders, and the second element is a tuple of parameters. The actual structure might vary depending on how you manage your database queries. Always validate and sanitize user input where applicable.
