To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, we need to be cautious of XML vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Here's a safe implementation:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.

    Parameters:
    - file_path: str, the path to the XML file to parse

    Returns:
    - root: Element, the root element of the parsed XML tree
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False))
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Parse error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


- **XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention**: By setting `resolve_entities=False`, we prevent the parser from resolving external entities, mitigating XXE vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling to manage parsing errors and other exceptions gracefully.
- **Security**: The function adheres to the principle of least privilege by not resolving external entities, thus reducing the attack surface.
