To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume a trusted environment where the source and destination of the pickled data are secure. Remember to always validate and sanitize inputs when loading data.

Here's how you can implement the two functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security Considerations**: 
  - **Serialization**: We use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` to ensure the most efficient and secure serialization.
  - **Deserialization**: It's crucial to only load pickle files from trusted sources to avoid arbitrary code execution. Consider using safer alternatives like `json` for simple data structures if possible.
  
- **File Handling**:
  - We ensure the directory exists for saving the file using `os.makedirs`.
  - Files are opened in binary mode (`'wb'` for writing, `'rb'` for reading) to ensure compatibility across different platforms.

- **Performance**: The use of the highest protocol for pickling offers better performance and reduced file size.

Always keep in mind that `pickle` should not be used for untrusted data. If you need to handle untrusted data, consider using other serialization formats like JSON or XML, which are more secure albeit less flexible for complex objects.
