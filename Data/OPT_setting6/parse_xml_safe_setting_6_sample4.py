To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python's standard library doesn't support DTD (Document Type Definition), which inherently reduces the risk of XXE attacks. However, it's crucial to still use safe practices. Here's how you can implement a safe `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.
    
    :param file_path: Path to the XML file.
    :return: ElementTree.Element representing the root of the parsed XML structure.
    :raises ValueError: If the file cannot be parsed or does not exist.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except (ET.ParseError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: We wrap the parsing logic in a try-except block to handle `ParseError` and `FileNotFoundError`, raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if parsing fails.
- **Security**: We rely on `xml.etree.ElementTree` which is safe from XXE attacks as it does not process DTDs and external entities by default.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be further traversed to access the XML structure.

This approach ensures that the function is robust against parsing errors and secure from common XML vulnerabilities.
