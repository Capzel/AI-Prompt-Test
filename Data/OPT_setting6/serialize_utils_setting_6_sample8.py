Certainly! Below are two functions: `save_object_to_file` and `load_object_from_file`. These functions use Python's `pickle` module for serialization and deserialization. However, be cautious with `pickle` as it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. It is crucial to only deserialize data you trust. In a production environment, consider using safer alternatives such as JSON or XML for trusted data.

Here's the code:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object and saves it to a file.
    
    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The file path where the object should be saved.
    """
    if not isinstance(file_path, str):
        raise ValueError("file_path must be a string.")
    
    dir_name = os.path.dirname(file_path)
    if dir_name and not os.path.exists(dir_name):
        os.makedirs(dir_name)

    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns a deserialized object from a file.
    
    :param file_path: The file path from which to load the object.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    :raises: FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.
    """
    if not isinstance(file_path, str):
        raise ValueError("file_path must be a string.")
    
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: '{file_path}'")

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

**Key Points:**
- **Input Validation**: Ensures `file_path` is a string and checks for file existence.
- **Directory Creation**: Automatically creates directories if they don't exist.
- **Security Warning**: Only load data from trusted sources due to potential security risks with `pickle`.
- **Protocol**: Uses `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for efficient serialization.
