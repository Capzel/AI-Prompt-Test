To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python, it's crucial to ensure that the XML is parsed in a way that prevents vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` library can be used in a secure manner by avoiding the usage of potentially dangerous features.

Here's a function that parses an XML file safely:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the XML file.

    Returns:
        ElementTree.Element: The root element of the parsed XML tree.
    
    Raises:
        ET.ParseError: If the XML cannot be parsed.
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
        PermissionError: If the file cannot be accessed due to permission issues.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
            tree = ET.parse(file)
            root = tree.getroot()
            return root
    except (ET.ParseError, FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) as e:
        raise e


- **Avoid External Entities:** `xml.etree.ElementTree` does not process external entities by default, which protects against XXE attacks.
- **Error Handling:** The function includes error handling for common exceptions such as parsing errors, file not found, and permission issues.
- **File Handling:** It uses a `with` statement for file operations to ensure proper resource management.

This approach ensures that the XML file is parsed securely, with appropriate error handling and resource management.
