To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python, we should ensure that the parsing process is resistant to common vulnerabilities, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Here's a secure implementation of the `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return a structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: Structured representation of the XML data.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False))
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"An error occurred: {e}")


- **Security**: The function uses a custom `ET.XMLParser` with `resolve_entities=False` to mitigate XXE attacks by preventing the parser from resolving external entities.
- **Error Handling**: It includes error handling for potential parsing errors (`ET.ParseError`) and other exceptions, raising a `RuntimeError` with a descriptive message.
- **Maintainability**: The code is structured and commented for clarity, ensuring it is easy to maintain and extend.
