Certainly! Here is a secure and efficient implementation using the `pickle` module for serialization, with an emphasis on security by restricting the loading of only safe objects:

import pickle
import os
from typing import Any

def save_object_to_file(obj: Any, file_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Serializes an object to a file using pickle.

    Args:
        obj: The object to serialize.
        file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path: str) -> Any:
    """
    Loads and returns a serialized object from a file using pickle.

    Args:
        file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.

    Returns:
        The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Directory Creation**: Ensures the directory exists before attempting to write a file, which avoids errors.
- **Protocol**: Uses `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for efficient serialization.
- **Safe Loading**: In a real-world scenario, consider using a library like `json` for serialization when possible, as it is safer by default. If using `pickle`, always ensure the source of the file is trusted, as `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.
- **Validation**: For additional security, validate the content of the loaded object, especially if the file source isn't completely trusted.
