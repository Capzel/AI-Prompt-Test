Certainly! Below are the two functions for serializing an object to a file and deserializing it back into a Python object. For security reasons, we'll use the `pickle` module with caution and ensure that the file operations are handled safely.

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize the object to a file using pickle."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL, fix_imports=False)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return the deserialized object from a file using pickle."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file, fix_imports=False)


- **Security Warning**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code if the serialized object is from an untrusted source. Only use it with trusted data.
- **Protocol**: We're using `protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` to ensure compatibility and efficiency.
- **Directory Handling**: `os.makedirs()` ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **File Existence Check**: We raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the file to be loaded does not exist, to prevent runtime errors. 

This code is designed to be both secure (when used with trusted data) and efficient, leveraging Python's native serialization capabilities.
