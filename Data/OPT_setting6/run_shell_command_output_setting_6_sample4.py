When executing shell commands from within a Python script, it's crucial to do so securely to avoid vulnerabilities such as shell injection. The `subprocess` module provides a way to execute shell commands, but care must be taken to handle inputs safely.

Here's a secure way to execute a shell command using Python's `subprocess.run`:

import subprocess
import shlex

def run_shell_command(command):
    command_list = shlex.split(command)
    
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command_list, check=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
        return result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return e.stderr


1. **Safety with `shlex.split()`:** This function safely parses the command string into a list, properly handling spaces and special characters, reducing the risk of shell injection.

2. **`subprocess.run()`:** This function is used to execute the command. The `check=True` parameter ensures that an exception is raised if the command returns a non-zero exit code, which is helpful for error handling.

3. **Capture Output Safely:** By setting `capture_output=True` and `text=True`, the function captures stdout and stderr as text, which is Python 3.7+ syntax. If you are using Python 3.6 or older, replace `capture_output=True` with `stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE`.

4. **Error Handling:** The code captures exceptions and returns stderr in case of errors, ensuring the application can handle command execution failures gracefully. 

This approach minimizes security risks and provides a robust mechanism to handle shell command execution in Python.
