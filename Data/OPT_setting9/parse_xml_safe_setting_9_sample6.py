To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to ensure that the XML content is well-formed and to handle any potential parsing errors gracefully. Here's a secure implementation of the `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree.Element object representing the root of the XML tree.
    :raises ValueError: If the XML file cannot be parsed.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except (ParseError, FileNotFoundError, ET.ElementTree.ParseError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function catches `ParseError` for malformed XML and `FileNotFoundError` for missing files, raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.
- **Security Considerations**: While `xml.etree.ElementTree` is generally safe for parsing trusted XML data, be cautious with untrusted input. For untrusted XML, consider using a library like `defusedxml` to mitigate XML-related vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML tree, allowing further processing of the XML structure.
