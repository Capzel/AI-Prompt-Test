To serialize and deserialize Python objects securely, we can use the `pickle` module with care. However, due to security concerns with `pickle` (as it can execute arbitrary code during deserialization), it's recommended to use `pickle` only with trusted data. For untrusted data, consider using safer alternatives like `json` for simple data structures.

Below are the functions using `pickle` for trusted data:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a file."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return a serialized object from a file."""
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security Warning**: Only use `pickle` with trusted data sources. It can execute arbitrary code if the data is tampered with.
- **Directory Handling**: The `save_object_to_file` function ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Binary Mode**: Files are opened in binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) for compatibility across different platforms.
- **Protocol**: The highest protocol is used for efficiency and compatibility with Python 3.x.
