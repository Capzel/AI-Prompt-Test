Certainly! Below are two functions that utilize Python's `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize objects. These functions are designed with security in mind, using the `pickle` module's `HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for serialization and ensuring that file operations are performed securely.

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object and saves it to a file.

    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns a serialized object from a file.

    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security Considerations**: The `pickle` module is inherently insecure when loading data from untrusted sources. Ensure that the file being loaded is from a trusted source to prevent arbitrary code execution.
- **File Handling**: The functions ensure that directories are created if they do not exist and that file operations are handled safely.
- **Error Handling**: The `load_object_from_file` function checks for file existence to prevent runtime errors.
