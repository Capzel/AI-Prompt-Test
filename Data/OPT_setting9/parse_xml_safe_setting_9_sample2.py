To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, we need to be cautious about potential XML vulnerabilities, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. To mitigate this, we should disable external entity processing. Here's how you can implement a secure `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree.Element representing the root of the parsed XML tree.
    """
    try:
        parser = ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=parser)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"An error occurred while parsing the XML file: {e}")


- **Disable External Entity Processing**: By setting `resolve_entities=False` in the `XMLParser`, we prevent the parser from resolving external entities, which mitigates XXE attacks.
- **Error Handling**: We handle `ET.ParseError` to catch and report parsing errors, and a general `Exception` to catch any other unexpected issues.
- **Return Type**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML tree, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.

This implementation ensures that the XML parsing is done securely and that any errors are appropriately handled and reported.
