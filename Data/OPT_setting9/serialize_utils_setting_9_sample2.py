To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with a focus on security. It's important to note that `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization, so it's generally unsafe to load data from untrusted sources. For secure applications, consider using safer serialization formats like JSON, if possible. However, if you must use `pickle`, here's how you can implement the functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serialize an object to a file using pickle.
    
    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Load and return an object from a file using pickle.
    
    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Warning**: Only use `pickle` to deserialize data you trust. Avoid using it with untrusted sources.
- **File Handling**: Use binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) for file operations to ensure compatibility across different platforms.
- **Directory Handling**: Use `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` to ensure the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for better performance and compatibility with newer Python versions.
