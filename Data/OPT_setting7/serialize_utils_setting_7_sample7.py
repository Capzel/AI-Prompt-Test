To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For secure serialization, it's better to use `json` for simple data types. However, if you need to serialize complex Python objects, you can use `pickle` with strict controls on what is being deserialized. Below are the functions using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object to a file using pickle.
    
    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns an object from a file using pickle.
    
    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: '{file_path}'")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


1. **Pickle Risks**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Only load data from trusted sources.
2. **File Path Handling**: Ensure the file path is validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks.
3. **Access Controls**: Ensure proper file permissions are set to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Environment**: Consider using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and reduce risk.
