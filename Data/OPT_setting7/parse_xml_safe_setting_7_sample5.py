To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. To mitigate these risks, we should disable the loading of external entities. Here's how you can implement a secure `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the parsed XML.
    """
    try:
        parser = ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=parser)
        return tree.getroot()
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **XMLParser with `resolve_entities=False`:** This disables the resolution of external entities, mitigating XXE vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling:** The function raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if parsing fails, allowing the caller to handle the error appropriately.
- **Return Value:** The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.

This implementation ensures that the XML parsing is done securely and robustly.
