To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to ensure that the XML content is well-formed and does not contain any malicious constructs. Here's a function that does this:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    :raises ValueError: If the XML file is not well-formed or cannot be parsed.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except (ParseError, FileNotFoundError, ET.ElementTree.ParseError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function handles parsing errors and file not found errors, raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if parsing fails.
- **Security Considerations**: While `xml.etree.ElementTree` is generally safe for parsing trusted XML, it is not immune to all XML vulnerabilities (e.g., XML External Entity (XXE) attacks). For untrusted XML, consider using `defusedxml` to mitigate these risks.
- **Structured Representation**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML tree, which can be used to navigate and manipulate the XML structure.
