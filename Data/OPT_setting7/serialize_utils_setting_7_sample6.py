To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module with caution, as it can be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution if loading data from untrusted sources. For secure serialization, consider using `json` for simple data types. However, if you need to serialize complex Python objects, here's how you can do it safely with `pickle`:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a file using pickle."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return an object from a file using pickle."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: '{file_path}'")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security Warning**: Only use `pickle` with trusted data sources. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.
- **Directory Handling**: The `save_object_to_file` function ensures the directory exists before attempting to write the file.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures that the most efficient protocol available is used for serialization.
- **File Existence Check**: The `load_object_from_file` function checks if the file exists before attempting to load it, raising a `FileNotFoundError` if it does not.
