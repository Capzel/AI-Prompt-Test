To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, you should use the `pickle` module with caution, as it can execute arbitrary code if the data is tampered with. For safer serialization, consider using `json` for simple data structures or `pickle` with strict controls. Below is an example using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Trusted Sources**: Only load data from trusted sources to avoid code execution vulnerabilities.
- **Access Controls**: Ensure proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Alternatives**: For untrusted data, consider safer serialization formats like JSON, though they are limited to basic data types.
