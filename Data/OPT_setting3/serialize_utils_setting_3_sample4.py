To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For secure applications, consider using `json` for serializing simple data structures or `pickle` with strict control over the data being deserialized. Below is an example using `pickle` with a warning about its use:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object to a file using pickle.
    
    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns an object from a file using pickle.
    
    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Warning**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Only use it with trusted data sources.
- **Directory Handling**: The `os.makedirs` function ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures the most efficient serialization format available.
