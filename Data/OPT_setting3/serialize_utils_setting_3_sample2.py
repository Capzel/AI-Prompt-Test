To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For secure serialization, it's better to use `json` for simple data types or `pickle` with strict control over the data being serialized and deserialized. Below is an example using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Warning**: `pickle` is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Only unpickle data you trust.
- **Directory Creation**: `os.makedirs` ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures the most efficient serialization.
- **File Handling**: Files are opened in binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) for writing and reading, respectively.
