To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module with caution, as it can execute arbitrary code if the data is tampered with. For enhanced security, consider using `pickle` only with trusted data sources. Here's how you can implement the two functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object and saves it to a file.
    
    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns a serialized object from a file.
    
    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Warning**: `pickle` is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Use it only with trusted sources.
- **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs` function ensures that the directory for the file path exists, preventing errors when writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures that the most efficient and secure protocol available is used for serialization.
