To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module with caution, as it can execute arbitrary code if the data is tampered with. For enhanced security, consider using `pickle` only with trusted data sources. Here's how you can implement the two functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a file."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return an object from a file."""
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security**: Only use `pickle` with trusted data sources. Avoid using it with untrusted data to prevent code execution vulnerabilities.
- **Protocol**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for better performance and compatibility with newer Python versions.
- **File Handling**: Use binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) for file operations to ensure compatibility across different platforms.
- **Directory Handling**: Ensure the directory exists before writing the file to prevent errors.
