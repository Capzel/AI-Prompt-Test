To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. To mitigate these risks, we should disable external entity processing. Here's how you can implement a safe `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: An ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False))
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"An error occurred while parsing the XML file: {e}")


- **Security**: The `resolve_entities=False` parameter in `ET.XMLParser` is used to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks by disabling the resolution of external entities.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling to manage parsing errors and other exceptions, providing clear feedback if something goes wrong.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.
