To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module in Python's standard library is not vulnerable to XXE by default, but it's still a good practice to handle XML parsing with care. Here's a secure implementation of the `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    :raises: ValueError if the XML file cannot be parsed.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except (ET.ParseError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for `ParseError` and `FileNotFoundError`, raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if parsing fails.
- **Security**: The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module is used directly, which is safe from XXE attacks by default in Python's standard library.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.

This implementation ensures that the function is robust against common errors and provides a clear interface for parsing XML files securely.
