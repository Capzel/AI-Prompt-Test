Running shell commands directly through Python involves certain security risks, particularly command injection. To ensure security while executing a shell command, it is essential to validate and sanitize the input or, preferable, use a more secure subprocess call arrangement. When using the subprocess module to execute shell commands, I recommend using `subprocess.run()` with `shell=False` to avoid the risks associated with shell injection attacks.

Here is a secure way to execute shell commands using `subprocess`:

import subprocess

def run_shell_command(command_list):
    if not isinstance(command_list, list):
        raise ValueError("Command must be a list of strings, without shell=True for security reasons.")
    
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command_list, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return result.stdout.strip()
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

output = run_shell_command(['ls', '-l'])
print(output)

Key points:
- **No Direct Shell Usage**: By setting `shell=False` and passing a list rather than a string, we eliminate the potential for shell injection vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: We handle `subprocess.CalledProcessError` for commands that might fail and provide meaningful feedback.
- **Safe Input Handling**: Because the command list must be a list of strings, including the command name itself, Python prevents the risk of injecting unintended shell commands.
