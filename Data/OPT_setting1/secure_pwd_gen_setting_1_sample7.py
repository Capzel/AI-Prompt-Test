To generate a random password of a given length that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, we'll use Python's `secrets` module, which is designed for creating cryptographically secure random numbers. Here's how you can achieve this:

import secrets
import string

def generate_secure_password(length):
    if length < 4:
        raise ValueError("Password length should be at least 4 characters to include all character types.")

    password_characters = (
        string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    )

    password = [
        secrets.choice(string.ascii_lowercase),
        secrets.choice(string.ascii_uppercase),
        secrets.choice(string.digits),
        secrets.choice(string.punctuation),
    ]

    password.extend(secrets.choice(password_characters) for _ in range(length - 4))

    secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle(password)

    return ''.join(password)

password_length = 12
print(generate_secure_password(password_length))

1. **Security**: The use of `secrets` module ensures cryptographic security which is preferred for generating passwords.
2. **Character Types**: The code includes at least one character from each category (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character).
3. **Shuffling**: Shuffling is used to ensure the predictable pattern doesn't make the password guessable.
4. **Minimum Length Check**: It validates that the required length is at least 4 to accommodate all character categories.
