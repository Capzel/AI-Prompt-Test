Here are the two functions to securely serialize and deserialize Python objects. We'll use the `pickle` module but ensure that both serialization and deserialization processes follow recommended security practices.

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize a Python object to a file."""
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileExistsError("File already exists and overwriting is not allowed.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Deserialize a Python object from a file."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("File does not exist.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Trustworthiness of Data**: Only unpickle data from trusted sources. Loading pickle data can execute arbitrary code unless ensured that the data is from a trusted source.
- **Backup and Version Control**: Ensure backups and file integrity checks (e.g., file hashes) are employed for both stored pickle files and application code, to confirm that neither has been tampered with.
- **Audit and Review**: Regularly audit and review the overall access framework in production environments to safeguard sensitive artifacts. Implement file access logging and anomaly detection.
