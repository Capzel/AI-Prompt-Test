Below are the implementations of two functions, `save_object_to_file` and `load_object_from_file`, that securely handle serialization and deserialization using Python's `pickle` module. It's essential to ensure that you trust the source of the data when deserializing, as loading data from untrusted sources can lead to security vulnerabilities due to potential arbitrary code execution.

import pickle

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serializes an object to a binary file."""
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Deserializes an object from a binary file."""
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Note**: Only use `pickle` deserialization when you trust the source of the serialized data to avoid potential security risks.
- **Protocol**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` to ensure efficient storage.
- **File Handling**: Make sure to handle file permissions securely. The example assumes that file paths and permissions are managed appropriately to prevent unauthorized access.
