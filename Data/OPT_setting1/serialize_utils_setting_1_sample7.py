To ensure secure serialization and deserialization of Python objects, it's crucial to use libraries that guard against common vulnerabilities. Here, I'll use `json` for the serialization process which requires your objects to be JSON serializable (i.e., typically basic types like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, etc.). For custom objects, you'll need to implement logic to convert to/from JSON, ensuring security and data integrity.

Here's a basic implementation:

import json
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a JSON file."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            json.dump(obj, file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
            print("Object successfully saved to file.")
    except (TypeError, IOError) as e:
        print(f"Error saving object to file: {e}")

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load an object from a JSON file and return it."""
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError("The specified file does not exist.")
        
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except (IOError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        print(f"Error loading object from file: {e}")
    return None

- **JSON Potential Limitations**: If you're serializing complex objects, you'll need to write methods to convert these objects to/from JSON-compatible structures.
- **File Permissions**: Ensure appropriate permissions are set for the file to protect sensitive data.
- **Validation**: Ensure that only valid and sanitized data is used in your program logic.
- **Error Handling**: Be robust with error handling to avoid unintentionally revealing sensitive information.
- **Review User Inputs**: Be cautious while loading from files if the path originates from user input to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.
