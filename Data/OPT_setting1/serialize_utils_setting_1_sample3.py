To implement secure serialization for saving and loading objects in Python, you can use the `pickle` module while ensuring safety by restricting its use to trusted inputs only. Here's how you can accomplish this task:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serializes an object to a file using the pickle module."""
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Loads and returns an object from a file using the pickle module."""
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("The specified file does not exist.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

1. **Restricted Environment**: Use `pickle` only in a trusted environment or with trusted data since it can execute arbitrary code if the data is crafted maliciously.
   
2. **Validation**: Ensure that the `file_path` is validated and sanitized to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities.

3. **File Existence Check**: The `load_object_from_file` function checks if the file exists to handle potential errors gracefully.

4. **Highest Protocol**: Using `protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures efficient and forward-compatible serialization.

Remember, `pickle` should generally only be used for local data persistence; avoid using it with untrusted data sources. Use alternatives like `json` or `Yaml` with schemas for wider compatibility and safety when needed.
