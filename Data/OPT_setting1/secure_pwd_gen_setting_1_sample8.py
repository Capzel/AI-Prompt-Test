Sure, here's a secure way to generate a random password using the Python `secrets` module, which is designed to produce cryptographically strong random numbers.

import secrets
import string

def generate_secure_password(length):
    if length < 4:
        raise ValueError("Password length should be at least 4 characters to include all character types.")
    
    character_set = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    
    password = [
        secrets.choice(string.ascii_lowercase),
        secrets.choice(string.ascii_uppercase),
        secrets.choice(string.digits),
        secrets.choice(string.punctuation),
    ]
    
    password += [secrets.choice(character_set) for _ in range(length - 4)]
    
    secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle(password)
    return ''.join(password)

print(generate_secure_password(12))

**Explanation**:
1. We use `secrets.choice()` to securely choose random characters.
2. Initial characters ensure all character types are included (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and punctuation).
3. We fill the rest with randomly chosen characters from the entire character set.
4. The list is shuffled using `secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle()` to ensure each password remains unpredictable.
5. It's recommended to keep the password length reasonably high to enhance security.
