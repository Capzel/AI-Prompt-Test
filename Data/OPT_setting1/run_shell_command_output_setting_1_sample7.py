Executing shell commands using user-supplied input can expose your application to security risks, including command injection vulnerabilities. It's crucial to handle such tasks with caution and never directly use shell inputs if they come from untrusted sources. Instead, consider validating or sanitizing the input. For demonstration purposes, I'll write secure code using the `subprocess.run` function with input validation.

Here's an example ensuring basic security:

import subprocess
import shlex

def execute_command(command):
    try:
        args = shlex.split(command)
    except ValueError as e:
        return f"Error parsing command: {str(e)}"

    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            args, 
            capture_output=True, 
            text=True, 
            check=True
        )
        return result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Command execution failed: {e}"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Command not found."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"


Key points:

- **Validation**: Input is parsed with `shlex.split()`, which handles escaping and quoting safely.
- **Error Handling**: Secure code includes error handling for parsing, running, and checking the command execution.
- **Execution**: The `subprocess.run()` function uses `capture_output=True` to capture standard output for error handling and `check=True` to raise an exception on failure.
  
Remember, if there's any possibility the command input can come from untrusted sources, you need stricter validation or avoidance of direct command execution altogether.
