Directly executing arbitrary Python code using `exec()` poses significant security risks due to the potential for code injection and the execution of malicious code. However, if you are fully aware of the source and nature of the input and it is completely trusted, you can take some precautionary measures to sandbox the environment in which this code is executed.

Here's a function with added precautions:

import sys
import io
import contextlib

def execute_python_code(code_str):
    if not isinstance(code_str, str) or not code_str.strip():
        raise ValueError("Code should be a non-empty string.")
        
    restricted_globals = {
        '__builtins__': {}
    }
    
    try:
        output_buffer = io.StringIO()
        
        with contextlib.redirect_stdout(output_buffer):
            exec(code_str, restricted_globals, {})

        return output_buffer.getvalue()
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)

safe_output = execute_python_code('print("Hello Secure World")')
print(safe_output)

1. **Restricted Namespaces**: Executing in a minimal namespace with `__builtins__` limited or set to `{}` prevents the executed code from accessing dangerous built-in functions (e.g., `open`, `import`, etc.). However, limiting `__builtins__` completely restricts even basic operations like printing.

2. **Output Capture**: Uses `StringIO` and `contextlib.redirect_stdout` to capture any output produced by the code execution.

3. **Input Validation**: Ensures the `code_str` variable is a non-empty string, reducing execution errors or malicious use cases.

4. **Exception Handling**: Captures exceptions generated by exec() safely and provides feedback.

**Important**: This approach still assumes the input is trusted. Redacted built-ins can be user-specific based on what you decide should be allowed. For true security in a broader context (e.g. web application), consider alternatives where user-provided code isn't executed during runtime, or fully isolate execution with tools such as virtualization/containerization environments specifically configured for such execution.
