Executing shell commands from within a Python application can introduce significant security risks, especially if user input is involved. The primary concern is shell injection, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands. However, if you must execute shell commands—ensuring you process only trusted or properly sanitized inputs—you can use the `subprocess` module safely.

Here's a secure example using `subprocess.run()` with a list of arguments to mitigate the injection risk, as you're likely executing a static or controlled command. This approach doesn't use shell=True, reducing inherent risks:

import subprocess

def run_shell_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, check=True, text=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        return result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error: {e.stderr}"

output = run_shell_command(['ls', '-l'])
print(output)

Key points for secure implementation:
- **Avoid `shell=True`**: This prevents shell injection since the command isn't interpreted by a shell.
- **Use a list rather than a string for the command and its arguments**: This avoids spaces or special characters being misinterpreted.
- **Capture stderr**: Provides error messages that can be logged for debugging purposes, ensuring you understand failures without exposing them to end users.
- **Carefully validate inputs** if user-derived commands/input is necessary to sanitize and validate thoroughly before execution.
