To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For secure serialization, consider using `json` for simple data types or `pickle` with strict control over the data being serialized and deserialized. Below is an example using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Pickle Security**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Only unpickle data from trusted sources.
- **File Permissions**: Ensure that the file permissions are set correctly to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Directory Creation**: Use `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` to safely create directories without raising an error if they already exist.
- **Protocol**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for better performance and compatibility with newer Python versions.
