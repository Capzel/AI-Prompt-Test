To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module, but with caution due to its potential security risks. For safer serialization, especially if the objects are simple data structures, consider using `json` or `yaml`. However, if you must use `pickle`, ensure that you trust the source of the data.

Here's how you can implement these functions using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Risks**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Only load data from trusted sources.
- **Directory Handling**: Ensure the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` for better performance and security.
- **Alternatives**: For safer serialization, consider using `json` for simple data types or `yaml` with `safe_load` for more complex structures.
