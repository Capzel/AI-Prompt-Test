To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Although `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python's standard library is not vulnerable to XXE by default, it's a good practice to ensure that external entities are not processed. Here's a secure implementation:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: Root element of the parsed XML tree.
    :raises: FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.
             ParseError if the XML is not well-formed.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file at {file_path} does not exist.")
    except ParseError as e:
        raise ParseError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for file not found and XML parsing errors, which helps in identifying issues during runtime.
- **Security**: `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python 3.3+ does not process external entities by default, mitigating XXE risks. However, always ensure your Python environment is up-to-date.
- **Maintainability**: The function is simple and focused, making it easy to maintain and extend if necessary.
