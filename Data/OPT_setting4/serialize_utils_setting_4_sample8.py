To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, you can use the `pickle` module, but it's important to note that `pickle` can execute arbitrary code and should not be used with untrusted data. For secure serialization, consider using `json` for simple data structures. However, if you must use `pickle`, ensure the environment is controlled and data is trusted.

Here's how you can implement the two functions using `pickle`:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serializes an object and saves it to a file.

    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Loads and returns a serialized object from a file.

    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security**: Only use `pickle` with trusted data. Avoid using it with data from untrusted sources to prevent code execution vulnerabilities.
- **File Handling**: The functions ensure the directory exists before writing and handle files in binary mode for compatibility with `pickle`.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures the most efficient serialization method available in your Python version.
