To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module in Python's standard library is not vulnerable to XXE by default, but it's still a good practice to handle XML parsing with caution. Here's a secure implementation:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the parsed XML.
    :raises: FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.
             ParseError if the file cannot be parsed as XML.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file at {file_path} was not found.")
    except ParseError as e:
        raise ParseError(f"Failed to parse XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `ParseError` to provide clear feedback if the file is missing or if the XML is malformed.
- **Security**: While `xml.etree.ElementTree` is not vulnerable to XXE by default, always ensure that the XML data source is trusted.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.
