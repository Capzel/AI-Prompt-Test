To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we should use the `pickle` module with caution due to its potential security risks. Instead, we can use the `json` module for serializing simple data structures, or `pickle` with additional safeguards if necessary. Here's how you can implement these functions using `pickle` with security considerations:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Security Warning**: `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization. Only use it with trusted data sources.
- **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs` function ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Protocol**: Using `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` ensures the most efficient serialization.
- **File Handling**: Files are opened in binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) for writing and reading, respectively.

For untrusted data, consider using JSON or other secure serialization formats, keeping in mind their limitations in terms of data types they can handle.
