Using `exec()` with arbitrary code poses significant security risks, as it can execute any Python code, potentially leading to code injection vulnerabilities. To mitigate safety risks while handling dynamic code execution, it's crucial to sandbox the environment and scrutinize the input carefully. However, absolute safety with `exec()` often isn't feasible, especially when handling input from untrusted sources.

Here's how you can structure a safer version, leveraging restricted built-in functions and capturing standard output:

import sys
import io
import traceback

def execute_python_code(code_str):
    restricted_globals = {
        "__builtins__": {
            "print": print,
            "range": range,
        }
    }

    output_stream = io.StringIO()

    original_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = output_stream

    try:
        exec(code_str, restricted_globals)
    except Exception as e:
        traceback.print_exc(file=output_stream)
    finally:
        sys.stdout = original_stdout

    return output_stream.getvalue()

code = "print('Hello, World!')"
result = execute_python_code(code)
print(result)

- **Restricted Built-ins**: Only enable necessary safe built-ins in the execution environment.
  
- **Output Redirection**: Capture standard output to return it.

- **Exception Handling**: Capture and print the stack trace of exceptions to provide debug context without leaking sensitive data from the host.

Keep in mind that any exposure to running arbitrary code strings is inherently unsafe, and despite these precautions, you should only use such a function in environments where you control all code inputs.
