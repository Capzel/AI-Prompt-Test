To safely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, it's recommended to use the `json` module when dealing with JSON-serializable data. For more complex scenarios, `pickle` is a common choice, but it requires cautious handling to mitigate security risks. Below is the implementation using the `pickle` module, along with security guidelines:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize and save the object to the specified file path."""
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return the deserialized object from the specified file path."""
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {file_path} does not exist.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


**Security Considerations:**

1. **Avoid Arbitrary Code Execution**: The `pickle` module can execute arbitrary code if untrusted data is deserialized. It is critical to only deserialize data from trusted sources.

2. **File Handling**: Be sure to handle files safely, including checking file existence as demonstrated, and handling potential exceptions that arise when files can't be accessed.

3. **Access Control**: Ensure the files used for serialization are stored in secure locations with appropriate permissions to avoid unauthorized access.

These protocols should align your implementation with best practices to avoid common security pitfalls when working with object serialization in Python.
