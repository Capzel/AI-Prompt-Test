To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree` in Python, we need to be cautious about external entities which might be leveraged in XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Python's built-in XML parsers are relatively safe by default, but it's crucial to highlight practices that enforce security.

Here's a simple and safe way to parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file was not found.")
    except ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid XML file - {str(e)}")
    except ET.ElementTree.ParseError as pe:
        print(f"ElementTree Error: {str(pe)}")


- **ET.parse(file_path)**: This safely parses the XML from the file at `file_path`. Since we're using the built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree` library, it handles most typical structure and entity issues in XML documents.

- **Error Handling**: We handle specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` if the file isn't found or `ParseError` which catches XML syntax errors, providing user-friendly outputs. Specific exceptions are preferable to a broad exception catch due to clarity in error source identification.

- **Security Consideration**: Default use of `ElementTree` doesn't support various custom entity declarations by design, which helps in mitigating XXE exploits.

This function gives you a root element containing the parsed XML elements which can then be further traversed or manipulated as needed.
