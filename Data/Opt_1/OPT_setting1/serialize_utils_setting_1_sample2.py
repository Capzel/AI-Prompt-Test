To achieve secure serialization and deserialization of objects in Python, it's recommended to use libraries like `json`, avoiding `pickle` due to its potential security risks. Let's assume the object `obj` is JSON serializable. I'll show you how to implement these functions safely using built-in modules:

import json
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize and save a JSON-serializable object to a file."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            json.dump(obj, file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
        os.chmod(file_path, 0o600)  # Secure the file permissions to user read/write only
    except (TypeError, IOError) as e:
        raise ValueError("Error in saving object to file") from e


def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return an object from a JSON file."""
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            obj = json.load(file)
        return obj
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError) as e:
        raise ValueError("Error in loading object from file") from e


1. **Security practices**: Use JSON for serialization instead of pickle to avoid code execution risks. The file permissions are restricted with `os.chmod` to protect metadata integrity and maintain user privacy.
   
2. **Error Handling**: Raise `ValueError` with a traceback to ensure users are aware of issues during file operations, improving robustness.
   
3. **Maintainability**: Using standard libraries like `json` ensures better future-proofing and clarity as JSON is well understood and documented.

Ensure that `obj` is JSON serializable before calling `save_object_to_file`. If the object contains elements not compatible with JSON serialization, you will need to implement additional logic to make it jsonify.
