Certainly! We'll use the `pickle` module for serialization and deserialization. However, it's important to note that using `pickle` can be insecure if you're working with untrusted data. Always ensure that the data you're loading is from a trusted source.


import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serialize an object to a file safely.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Load and deserialize an object from a file.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("The specified file does not exist.")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        obj = pickle.load(file)
        
    return obj


1. **Trusted Data Only**: Ensure you only unpickle data that is from a trusted source.
2. **Access Control**: The file permissions are critically important. You may optionally enforce stricter file permissions on `posix` compliant systems by setting the file mode using `os.chmod(file_path, 0o600)` after writing.
3. **Alternatives**: For sending objects over the network or between different environments, consider using formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers which are safer for untrusted data.
