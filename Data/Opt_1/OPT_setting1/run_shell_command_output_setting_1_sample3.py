To safely execute a shell command using Python's `subprocess` module and return its output as a string, you need to be cautious to prevent shell injection vulnerabilities. Utilizing the `subprocess.run()` function with proper parameterization will help you achieve secure execution.

Here is a secure way to perform the requested task:

import subprocess
import shlex

def run_shell_command(command):
    command_parts = shlex.split(command)
    
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command_parts, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        
        return result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

print(run_shell_command('echo "Hello, World!"'))


1. **Use shlex.split():** This function safely handles shell command strings by splitting them into a list, avoiding many injection issues inherent with direct shell calls.

2. **subprocess.run():** Use this function for executing shell commands. It provides binary (`stdout` and `stderr`) and simplified string (`text` mode) results.

3. **capture_output=True and text=True:** These flags help capture command outputs for both standard output and error streams conveniently as text.

4. **check=True:** This parameter makes `subprocess.run()` raise an exception if the command fails, allowing you to handle errors gracefully.

This approach ensures the command line isnâ€œt improperly interpreted, reducing the risk of shell injection vulnerabilities. This minimalist explanation highlights the importance of using `shlex.split()` to parse widely varied input safely.
