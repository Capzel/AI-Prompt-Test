To ensure safe parsing of XML files, it's important to avoid vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module in Python can be used securely by disabling external entity processing. Here's how you can implement a safe `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the parsed XML.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

- **Security**: The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module in Python 3.3+ is secure by default against XXE attacks because it does not process external entities.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes basic error handling to manage parsing errors and unexpected exceptions.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML tree, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.

This function is designed to be both secure and straightforward, ensuring that the XML file is parsed without exposing the application to common XML-related vulnerabilities.
