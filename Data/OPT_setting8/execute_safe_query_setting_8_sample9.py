To execute a SQL query safely, it's crucial to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries. However, since `user_query` is a complete query string, it can't be directly parameterized. Instead, you should use a safe approach to validate or sanitize the query, or better yet, use an ORM or a query builder to construct queries safely.

If you must execute a raw query, ensure that it comes from a trusted source or is properly validated. Hereâ€™s a basic example using Python's `sqlite3` library, which supports parameterized queries:

import sqlite3

def execute_safe_query(db_connection, user_query, params=None):
    try:
        if not isinstance(db_connection, sqlite3.Connection):
            raise ValueError("Invalid database connection")


        with db_connection:
            cursor = db_connection.cursor()
            if params:
                cursor.execute(user_query, params)
            else:
                cursor.execute(user_query)
            results = cursor.fetchall()
            return results
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None


- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection when dealing with user inputs.
- **Validation**: If executing raw queries, ensure they are validated or sanitized.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle and log errors without exposing sensitive information.
- **Database Connection**: Ensure the connection is valid and managed properly, using context managers (`with` statement) to handle transactions and resource cleanup.
