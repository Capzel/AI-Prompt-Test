Certainly! To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module. However, since `pickle` can execute arbitrary code during deserialization, it's important to ensure that the source of the serialized data is trusted. For secure environments, consider using `pickle` only with trusted data. Here are the functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """Serialize an object to a file."""
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """Load and return an object from a file."""
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"No such file: '{file_path}'")
    
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)

- **Security**: Only use `pickle` with trusted data sources to avoid code execution vulnerabilities.
- **File Handling**: The `save_object_to_file` function ensures the directory exists before writing the file.
- **Error Handling**: The `load_object_from_file` function checks for file existence to prevent runtime errors.
- **Protocol**: `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` is used for efficiency and compatibility with the latest Python versions.
