To securely serialize and deserialize objects in Python, we can use the `pickle` module with a focus on security by ensuring that we only load trusted data. Here's how you can implement the two functions:

import pickle
import os

def save_object_to_file(obj, file_path):
    """
    Serialize an object to a file using pickle.

    :param obj: The object to serialize.
    :param file_path: The path to the file where the object will be saved.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(obj, file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

def load_object_from_file(file_path):
    """
    Load and return an object from a file using pickle.

    :param file_path: The path to the file from which the object will be loaded.
    :return: The deserialized object.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        return pickle.load(file)


- **Pickle Security**: `pickle` is not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Only unpickle data you trust.
- **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs` function ensures the directory exists before writing the file, preventing potential errors.
- **File Handling**: Always open files in binary mode when dealing with `pickle` to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

This code is intended for use in a controlled environment where the data source is trusted. For scenarios where security is a concern, consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or YAML, especially when dealing with untrusted input.
