To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module in Python's standard library is vulnerable to XXE by default. However, since Python 3.3, the `defusedxml` package provides a safer alternative by disabling potentially harmful features.

Here's how you can write a secure function using `defusedxml`:

from defusedxml import ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: An ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

- **Use `defusedxml`:** This library is a drop-in replacement for `xml.etree.ElementTree` that mitigates security risks such as XXE.
- **Error Handling:** The function includes basic error handling to manage parsing errors and unexpected exceptions gracefully.
- **Return Structure:** The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.
