To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to ensure that the XML content is well-formed and that external entities are not processed, which can prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Here's a secure implementation of the `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parse an XML file and return its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path, parser=ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False))
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")
        return None
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None


- **Disabling External Entities**: The `ET.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)` ensures that external entities are not resolved, mitigating XXE vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for common exceptions such as `ET.ParseError` and `FileNotFoundError`, providing feedback without exposing sensitive information.
- **Security and Maintainability**: The function is designed to be secure and maintainable, adhering to best practices in error handling and resource management.
