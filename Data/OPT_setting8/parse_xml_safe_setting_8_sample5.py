To safely parse an XML file using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, it's important to be aware of potential security risks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Although `xml.etree.ElementTree` is not vulnerable to XXE by default, it's a good practice to be cautious when dealing with XML input from untrusted sources. Here's a safe implementation of the `parse_xml_file` function:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from xml.etree.ElementTree import ParseError

def parse_xml_file(file_path):
    """
    Safely parses an XML file and returns its structured representation.

    :param file_path: Path to the XML file to be parsed.
    :return: ElementTree Element representing the root of the XML structure.
    :raises ValueError: If the XML file cannot be parsed.
    """
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return root
    except (ET.ParseError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error parsing XML file: {e}")


- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling for parsing errors (`ET.ParseError`) and file not found errors (`FileNotFoundError`). It raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if parsing fails.
- **Secure Defaults**: `xml.etree.ElementTree` is used with its default settings, which are generally safe against XXE attacks. However, always be cautious with XML from untrusted sources.
- **Structured Representation**: The function returns the root element of the parsed XML, which can be used to navigate the XML structure.
