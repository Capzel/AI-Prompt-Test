# Security Flaws in Generative AI Code – Thesis Repository

This repository is an extension of our Bachelor’s thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It contains the scripts, prompt configurations, datasets, and analysis tools used to explore how prompt strategies and model parameters influence the security of code generated by large language models (LLMs). If you're curious about the data, implementation details, or reproducibility of our findings, try yourself.

## 🧪 Project Summary

This project investigates how different prompt engineering techniques and hyperparameter settings (temperature and top-p) affect the occurrence of security vulnerabilities in AI-generated Python code. We:
- Used OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate code across 9 categories.
- Analyzed the generated code using [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) for security flaws.
- Compared optimized vs. unoptimized prompts.
- Evaluated how tuning generation randomness (temperature/top-p) influenced security.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Prompt-Test.git
   cd security-flaws-llm
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   ```

4. Run the Bandit analysis or data processing pipeline:
   ```bash
   python analysis/summarize_banditv2.py --input data/ --output results/
   ```

## 📊 Key Tools Used

- **OpenAI GPT-4o API** — for generating code under varying configurations.
- **Bandit** — for static analysis of Python security vulnerabilities.
